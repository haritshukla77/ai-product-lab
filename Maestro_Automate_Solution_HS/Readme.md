# Developer Newsletter Automation with UiPath Maestro

A hands-on implementation of a developer newsletter automation,
built using UiPath Maestro Automate and Visual Studio Code.

This project follows the DevPulse GeeksforGeeks demo by
[dushyant-uipath](https://github.com/dushyant-uipath/geeksforgeeks-automate-demo).

## Overview

The workflow explores how API calls, scripting, and an autonomous
agent can work together to prepare a developer news digest.

## Workflow

1. **Manual trigger** — starts the automation.
2. **HTTP request** — retrieves news through the Hacker News Algolia API.
3. **Script** — prepares the retrieved data for the agent.
4. **Autonomous agent** — processes the stories to draft newsletter content.

## Tools Used

- UiPath Maestro Automate
- Visual Studio Code
- Hacker News Algolia API

## Learning Focus

- Building workflows in UiPath Maestro Automate.
- Connecting an external API to an automation.
- Preparing data using a script.
- Incorporating an autonomous agent into a workflow.
- Debugging and inspecting execution traces.

## Running the Project

Open the solution using the appropriate UiPath tooling in VS Code.
Configure the required connections and model access before running
the workflow through its manual trigger.

For the original demo's setup instructions, see the source
repository linked below. Its paths and configuration may differ
from this implementation.
